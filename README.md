# Wazuh Alert Integration System

[The System Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*vdGyC9FUDVa33muSRR4N_Q.png)

## Overview
This system integrates Wazuh alerts with TheHive and MISP to manage and correlate security alerts effectively. It is designed to be modular, allowing for easy adaptation to various security environments. The integration facilitates the automation of alert processing, searching for hash matches in MISP, and case creation in TheHive based on these matches.

## Key Components
- `config.py`: Manages configuration settings and environment variables.
- `main.py`: Initializes and runs the Flask application.
- `misp.py`: Handles interactions with MISP including searching for hash values.
- `thehive.py`: Manages alert creation and case processing in TheHive.
- `routes.py`: Configures Flask routes to handle incoming webhook requests.
- `utils.py`: Provides utilities for data extraction and hash data parsing.

## Installation

### Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher is recommended. Install all necessary Python packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup
You must configure the environment variables before running the application. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and include the following variables:
```
THEHIVE_URL=http://example.com/thehive
THEHIVE_KEY=YourTheHiveAPIKey
MISP_URL=http://example.com/misp
MISP_KEY=YourMISPAPIKey
MISP_VERIFYCERT=True
```

- `THEHIVE_URL`: URL of TheHive instance.
- `THEHIVE_KEY`: API key for TheHive.
- `MISP_URL`: URL of the MISP instance.
- `MISP_KEY`: API key for MISP.
- `MISP_VERIFYCERT`: Set to `False` to disable SSL certificate verification if needed.

### Running the Application
To start the Flask server, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
The server will start in debug mode and listen for incoming webhook requests.

## Usage
Send JSON payloads from Wazuh to the `/webhook` endpoint configured in `routes.py`. The system will process these alerts, search for hash matches in MISP, and automatically create alerts and cases in TheHive.
## Configuring Wazuh to Send Webhook Notifications

To enable Wazuh to send webhook notifications to our Flask application, you need to add a new integration in the `ossec.conf` configuration file of your Wazuh manager. This setup allows Wazuh to send alerts (with a level of 3 or higher, as recommended) to the Flask application via a webhook.

Hereâ€™s how to configure this in your `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`:

```xml
<integration>
    <name>custom-webhook</name>
    <hook_url>http://<your_flask_server_ip>:<port>/webhook</hook_url>
    <alert_format>json</alert_format>
    <level>3</level>
</integration>
```

### Configuration Details:
- **name**: This should be `custom-webhook` or any other name you choose that describes the integration.
- **hook_url**: Replace `<your_flask_server_ip>` and `<port>` with the IP address and port number where your Flask application is running.
- **alert_format**: Set to `json` as the Flask endpoint expects JSON data.
- **level**: Setting this to `3` means that all alerts of level 3 and above will be sent. Adjust this value based on the sensitivity and volume of alerts you wish to process.

### Adding to ossec.conf:
Insert the above XML configuration into the `ossec.conf` file located typically in `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` on your Wazuh manager. Ensure it is placed within the `<ossec_config>` root configuration tag.

### Restart Wazuh Manager:
After updating the configuration, restart the Wazuh manager to apply changes:
```bash
service wazuh-manager restart
```

This configuration ensures that alerts of level 3 and above are automatically sent to your Flask application, enabling automated processing and integration with TheHive and MISP. Adjust the alert level according to your organizational needs to either increase or reduce the number of alerts processed by the system.
## Modularity and Configuration
This application is designed to be highly modular. Future configurations can be made to adapt to different types of data inputs and to refine the data that triggers alerts or cases.

## Future Plans (TODO)
- **Configuration Expansion**: Move hardcoded lists and values to a configuration file or database for easier management.
  - **Files to Update**:
    - `thehive.py`: Modify excluded keys in `generate_artifacts` and adjust the artifact creation logic.
    - `utils.py`: Update hash types and parsing logic in `parse_hash_data` to accommodate additional or different hash types.
  - **Lines to Adjust**:
    - Lines involving `exclude_keys` in `thehive.py`.
    - Hash parsing logic in `utils.py`, specifically in the `parse_hash_data` function.

- **Enhancing Flexibility**:
  - Abstract more functionality into configurable modules or external configuration settings.
  - Allow for dynamic adjustment of logging levels and more detailed error handling strategies.

Contributors can refer to these plans for enhancing the system's functionality and customizing it to fit specific organizational needs. Contributions to extend compatibility, improve error handling, and increase the configurability of the system are welcome.
